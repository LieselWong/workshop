###Lecture
* www-data is a 'user' for Ubuntu and allows it to access your website files. 

### Classwork
* We continued to work on deploying our P01 flask apps on Digital Ocean in class.
* Check the QAF postings! There is important information on that resource, and you could also contribute to the class knowledge base!

### Reminder
* If you have successfully deployed your flask app, submit it to a google form (that can be found on QAF).
