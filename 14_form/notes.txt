TEMPLATE
Observations:
- In a form tag, you can put an action="/path" which runs the python code that uses the same route. The path is where the form data is going to go.
- Forms let you send data to somewhere!!
- Input tags have types. The type "text" allows you to submit text and the type "submit" lets click a button to send data to a server. Input tags also have names which could be the name of the data input. The name attribute allows you to access it elsewhere (in the backend)

Predictions:
- A space to type in your username and a submit button appears.
- When the user submits the form, the function authenticate() will run because they use the same app.route to /auth. 

APP
Observations:
- 

Predictions: 
- The user will see the "Waaaa hooo HAAAH" message, once the user submits the form asking for their username. (THIS IS TRUE)
- the disp_loginpage() function displays data about the app file and the input data of the user from the form.
