I thought it was interesting how both my partners used similar methods. Specifically, they created an interval and checked the random number was inside the \
interval. Then, they printed the job if the percentage was between the interval. \

Common Approaches:
DictReader to read in the csv file.
Randomly generated number and intervals to determine the job to output. Some people omitted the upper limit, and only checked the lower limit. 

Other Approaches:
Pandas
