error: attempt to write a readonly database
*chmod* changes the permissions in a file
command: chown -R www-data: www-data, changes every file in the directory so 
it is owned by apache
>> to undo this command: sudo chown wenhao: wenaho database.py,
 makes wenhao admin and it still works????

ls -l >> see permissions 

The flask app on apache seems to break if there isn't a "if __name__ == '__main__'" for the app.run() line

Adding the following lines to your wsgi file allows you to set the directory of your venv:
```
WSGIDaemonProcess <whatever> python-home=path/to/venv
WSGIProcessGroup <whatever>
WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
```
